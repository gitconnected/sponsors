We are truly grateful for all the amazing people and companies that support gitconnected, and to our users who are incredibly passionate for what we are building. The gitconnected platform and [publication](https://levelup..gitconnected.com "gitconnected publication") have been funded by the founders for over a year, and we are excited to announce we will be launching a [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/gitconnected "gitconnected Patreon account") (coming soon). By supporting us as a patron, you will have your name or company logo featured on the gitconnected platform, our publication, in our GitHub, and any other gitconnected locations on the internet.
